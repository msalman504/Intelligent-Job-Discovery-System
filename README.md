## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is set up to run directly in the browser without a build step.

### Prerequisites

You will need API keys for the following services:

1.  **Google Gemini API**: For all AI-powered features. Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **JSearch API**: For fetching job listings. Get a key by subscribing to the API on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/jsearch).

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intelligent-job-discovery.git
    cd intelligent-job-discovery
    ```

2.  **Configure API Keys:**

    *   **Google Gemini API Key**:
        *   Open the file `services/geminiService.ts`.
        *   Find the line: `const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";`
        *   Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Gemini API key.

    *   **JSearch API Key**:
        *   Open the file `services/jsearchService.ts`.
        *   Find the line: `const JSEARCH_API_KEY = "YOUR_JSEARCH_API_KEY_HERE";`
        *   Replace `"YOUR_JSEARCH_API_KEY_HERE"` with your own key from RapidAPI.

3.  **Serve the application:**
    Since there's no build process, you can use any simple static file server.

    *   **Using Python:**
        ```bash
        # If you have Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```

    *   **Using Node.js (with `http-server`):**
        ```bash
        # Install http-server globally if you haven't already
        npm install -g http-server
        
        # Run the server
        http-server
        ```

4.  **Open in browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by your server). The application should now be running.
